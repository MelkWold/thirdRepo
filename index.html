    <h1>A hyphenated introduction of HTML</h1>
    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (<strong>HTML</strong>) is a powerful and versatile web programming language that allows users define the structure and style of websites as well as the way website elements are displayed on browsers. In short, HTML is the basic building block of all webpages. </p>

    <p>In addition, HTML can be integrated with other powerful programming languages like CSS and JavaScript to produce beautiful and interactive websites, respectively. In addition, frameworks like React, Angular and Vue are often used with HTML while developing webpages. </p>

    <p> Some basic vocabulary that you need to know before continuing include:  </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</strong>: refers to the address of a website on a server. E.g. https://www.google.com</li>
        <li><strong>Server</strong>: a repository that stores all the data associated with websites, receives and processes requests sent from clients and sends the appropriate responses back to the client.</li>
        <li><strong>Client</strong>: any one that sends a request to a server, e.g. using a web browser or via API  </li>
        <li><strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong>: the objects or the elements in an HTML document. E.g. paragraphs, links, images, tables, etc</li>

        <h2>Description of the components of the HTML template</h2>
            <li><strong>"!DOCTYPE html":</strong>  denotes the version of HTML used and informs the HTML validator to follow the HTML standards when checking the code.</li>
            <li><strong>"html":</strong> instructs the web browser that the document is an HTML document and indicates the start of the HTML document (a.k.a. the root of the document. </li>
            <li><strong>"head":</strong> contains the necessary metadata including title, character encoding, language and the like. Note that the metadata of a web document are not displayed on the web browser.  </li>
            <li><strong>"body":</strong> contains all the data and content that is going to be displayed on the web site</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> HTML Tags</h2>
    <p>HTML tags are the fundamental building blocks of an HTML document and are used to format the contents of a website and determine its structure and style. Most HTML tags begin and end with angle brackets ('<>') with the respective element contained in between. </p>

    <p>Note: In addition to the tags displayed below, there are tags that do not require the closing angle bracket known as <strong>"self-closing tags"</strong> or <strong>"void tags"</strong> . Some examples of void tags include: img, br, source, input, embed </p>
